# TilerTheCreator
A Simple Utility library for using the Tiling functions of Tactile-Js without needing to know much about how tiling works. 

At the time of this writing Tactile.js isn't incorporated into the NPM system, and there were some problems installing with NPM so in order to install please run

    yarn install

There is a test, called TestTiler.js. You can run that with 

    Node TestTiler.js

You will get a console log "Tiler working fine" if everything is ok, or "No Polygons returned from Tiler" if there is a problem, but I have not experienced in problems yet so please let me know if you find issues.
